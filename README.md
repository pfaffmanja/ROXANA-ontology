# ROXANA-ontology -- **R**eference **O**ntology for E**X**pert bound processes in Ma**NA**f**A**cturing
An ontology for representing expert-bound processes in manufacturing. 

## Introduction
The difficulty with predominantly manual activities lies in the individuality of the processes, the products and the resulting lack of standardization. Only a few employees in the companies concerned can carry out the operations. It is not uncommon for employees to remain in the companies for a very long time, gaining valuable experience and building up knowledge over the years. This knowledge can rightly be called the most valuable resource. Existing public ontologies still lack adequate representation of expert knowledge. A knowledge model needs to be designed which describes activities in detail, including the associated process dependencies, but which can be extended adaptively and situation-specifically to include work activities.
